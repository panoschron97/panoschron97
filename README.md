Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Panagiotis Chronopoulos. I am a recent graduate from the Department of Information and
Communication Systems Engineering at Karlovasi, Samos, Greece.

I possess a strong foundation in Data Science, Data Analysis and SQL (including Oracle PL/SQL, Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and PL/pgSQL). 

I am particularly interested in roles such as Data Analyst, Database Administrator, SQL Developer, PL/SQL Developer and Data Engineer.

Note : These projects are all made by me even if i had collaborate with some colleagues through my academic years in university in some of them and of course they are personal projects and they don't demostrate clear all my skills. Most of them that i made is to show myself what i know and what i'm capable to do - to know that i worth something so someone can hire me. Of course i am a team player and i want to work in a team and help them with the knowledge that i have granted from the university and from my personal studies and projects.
